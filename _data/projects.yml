    The eDataLyzer is a existing semiconductor analytics product for wafer yield map classification and root cause correlation.
    The goal of this project is to redevelop the eDataLyzer for big data.
    So we have led this project in three ways.  
    <ul class="resume-item-list">
      <li>
        1st, reconstruct the architecture to micro services from monolithic one.
      </li>
      <li>
        2nd, reorganize to a role based teams from a unified team.(Client, Server, Algorithm, Research, Technical Sales/Support.)
      </li>
      <li>
        3rd, redevelop by Java and C\# not only C\#.
      </li>
    </ul>
    I belong to Algorithm team, mainly focusing on parallelizing algorithm by new big data technologies.
    This project had three subproject.
    In briefly, I have done three ways of parallelizing algorithms.
    <ul class="resume-item-list">
      <li>
        1st, I had redeveloped the algorithms by Java, PostgreSQL, Spring for small data clients.
      </li>
      <li>
        2nd, I had redeveloped the algorithms by non Hadoop based technologies.(GreenPlumDataBase PL/Java, Oracle-R)
      </li>
      <li>
        3rd, I had redeveloped the algorithms by Hadoop based technologies.(Hadoop, BDA, Hawq, HBase, Spark, Eco system)
      </li>
    </ul>
    In this project, we have a lot of semiconductor clients. 
    <ul class="resume-item-list">
      <li>
        Korea - Samsung Electronics, SKHynix, SKSiltron
      </li>
      <li>
        Japan, Taiwan, China - Toshiba, Sharp, TSMC, BOE
      </li>
    </ul>
    </ul>
