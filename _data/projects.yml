    The eDataLyzer is a existing semiconductor analytics product for wafer yield map classification and root cause correlation.
    The goal of this project is to redevelop the eDataLyzer for big data.
    So we have led this project in three ways.  
    <ul class="resume-item-list">
      <li>
        1st, reconstruct the architecture to micro services from monolithic one.
      </li>
      <li>
        2nd, reorganize to a role based teams from a unified team.(Client, Server, Algorithm, Research, Technical Sales/Support.)
      </li>
      <li>
        3rd, redevelop by Java and C# not only C#.
      </li>
    </ul>
    I belong to Algorithm team, mainly focusing on parallelizing algorithm by new big data technologies.
    This project had three subproject.
    In briefly, I have done three ways of parallelizing algorithms.
    <ul class="resume-item-list">
      <li>
        1st, I had redeveloped the algorithms by Java, PostgreSQL, Spring for small data clients.
      </li>
      <li>
        2nd, I had redeveloped the algorithms by non Hadoop based technologies.(GreenPlumDataBase PL/Java, Oracle-R)
      </li>
      <li>
        3rd, I had redeveloped the algorithms by Hadoop based technologies.(Hadoop, BDA, Hawq, HBase, Spark, Eco system)
      </li>
    </ul>
    The clients of this project are various as follows. And the project types are PoC, Pilot and Production.
    <ul class="resume-item-list">
      <li>
        Korea - Samsung Electronics, SKHynix, SKSiltron
      </li>
      <li>
        Japan, Taiwan, China - Toshiba, Sharp, TSMC, BOE
      </li>
    </ul>

# RL
- project: Research to Apply Reinforcement Learning on Semiconductor
  role: Researcher, Software Engineer
  duration: Dec. 2018 ~ Present, 9 months, 6 M/M
  # url: "#"
  description: 
    The goal of this project is to apply reinforcement learning on semiconductor and share the experience with team.
    I pick up 8-Puzzle as a environment for reinforcement learning.
    Here's why I pick up it in details.
    <ul class="resume-item-list">
      <li>
        In order to collaborate with teammates, I need to find the generalized environment easy to apply Graph Theory.
        So I pick up operation management of production on semiconductor.
      </li>
      <li>
        In order to find suitable environment not complex one, So I pick up 8-Puzzle.
        Focus on shortest-path not yield, productivity, stability, automation rate, etc
      </li>
    </ul>
    The recent research situation is as follows.
    <ul class="resume-item-list">
      <li>
        1st, solve 8-Puzzle by Dynaminc Programming
      </li>
      <li>
        2nd, fail to solve 8-Puzzle by QLearning, Deep SARSA, Polish Gradient
      </li>
    </ul>
    The rest of the research is to find out why and how to overcome it.

# MP
- project: Develop Matrix Profile on Transfer System 
  role: Software Engineer
  duration: Jul. 2017 ~ Dec. 2017, 5 months, 2 M/M
  url: "https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/MatrixProfile.html"
  description: 
    The goal of this project is to predict a shutdown of motor based on time series sensed data.
    Client's product-lines(blue-collars) found out a shutdown once a year and hate this problem.
    But both client's office-lines(white-collars) and our previous algorithm didn't predict it.
    Because the algorithm focus on a vibration analysis on rotationary machine.
    So we created this project as a subproject of the previous one and led this project as below.
    <ul class="resume-item-list">
      <li>
        1st, we found out the matrix profile which is a suitable algorithm for time series predict.
      </li>
      <li>
        2nd, I implemented the algorithm in python and deploy it to client. And solve the problem successfully.
      </li>
      <li>
        3rd, I implemented it in java and integrate with UI. Teached them how to solve their problem through our product.
      </li>
    </ul>
    The client of this project is Hyundai Motor. And the project type is PoC.

# PdM
- project: Develop Predictive Maintenance on Semiconductor
  role: Software Engineer
  duration: Nov. 2016 ~ Mar. 2017, 5 months, 4 M/M
  # url: ""
  description: 
    The goal of this project is to provide predictive maintenance on semiconductor's etching tools.
    In order to change this client's empirical maintenance by condition and time, we led this project as below.
    <ul class="resume-item-list">
      <li>
        1st, redefine input data through Self Organizing Map. And define health scores from distance of each vectors of input data and observation vector.
      </li>
      <li>
        2nd, apply Double Exponential Weighted Moving Average to the health scores. And get Remaining Useful Life for each vectors of input data.
      </li>
    </ul>
    But we got a feedback that our product was too late for client. So we additionally led this project as follows.
    <ul class="resume-item-list">
      <li>
        1st, detect the bottle neck of our product as the DEWMA not the SOM.
      </li>
      <li>
        2nd, apply Spark and HDFS on 2nd DEWMA algorithm.
        And find out a tuning point. 
        For example, use dynamic number of option dfs.replication not static default 3 depends on data's variety and volume.
      </li>
    </ul>
    The client of this project is SKHynix. And the project type is pilot.
