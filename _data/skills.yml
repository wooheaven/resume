               Using this, we can re-construct the previous monolithic application into micro services architect.
               Using this, we can re-build the previous configure hell party into AOP based application.

# Database
- skill: Database - Oracle, PostgreSQL, HBase
  description: I have used Oracle for a year on production.
               Because it's used by most semiconductor clients.
               I have use PostgreSQL for 6 years on production.
               Because it's a alternative of Oracle. It's easy to use and especially good for performance over price.
               I have used HBase for a year on production.
               Because it's a alternative of Oracle. It's hard to use but better than PostgreSQL especially on performance.

# Bigdata
- skill: Bigdata - GPDB, Hadoop, Spark
  description: We realized that it takes a long time to extend my previous product to big data with Java alone. 
               In order to reduce the time, we find out the following Bigdata platform which enable us to focus on business logic of the product.
               1st, GPDB PL/Java is a static platform which enable us to handle data by SQL, compute data by Java.
               2nd, Hadoop Spark is a dynamic platform which enable us to handle and compute data by Java. Using Hadoop with other platform not Spark, we couldn't overcome PoC.
               I have used GPDB for 6 years.
               I have used Hadoop, Spark for 4 years.
